Considering a 3D compact structure with permittivity $\epsilon (\vec{r})$ and permeability $\mu (\vec{r})$ with $R$ as the radius of the sphere that encloses the system. Outside the bounding structure, $\epsilon (\vec{r})=\mu (\vec{r})=1$ so electric and magnetic fields follow helmholtz equation and can be expanded in spherical harmonics and spherical Hankel functions with wavenumber $k=\frac{\omega}{c}$. A bound state must have no radiating far field, but every term in the expansion carries an outgoing Poynting flux, and hence, all terms must be zero, meaning that $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{H}$ must both vanish for $|r| > R$. If $\epsilon (\vec{r})$ and $\mu (\vec{r})$ are neither infinite nor zero anywhere, continuity of the fields requires $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{H}$ to be zero everywhere in space, and as a result, such a bound state cannot exist.
