> [!question] First how do we determine if a bound state exists or not?
> Simple, just have a look at the frequency.
> If it is outside the continuous spectral range of the propagating waves, it can exist as a bound state since it has no way for it to radiate away.
> On the other hand, a wave state with frequency inside the spectral range of the propagating waves can only be a resonance that leaks out radiation and extends to infinity.
> This is the conventional wisdom but [[Bound States in the continuum|BICs]] donot follow this convention. They exist in the continuum with the extended waves remaining perfectly localized and without radiating any energy.
