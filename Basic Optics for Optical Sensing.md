- Whenever we talk about optical sensing, we talk about the IR, Visible range.
- Most of the optical materials are reactive to the electric field more than the magnetic field.
	- The reason being that $\frac{F_{mag}}{F_{elec}}=\frac{v}{c}$. Since $v$ is less than $c$, so the magnetic field has negligible effect on most of the optical materials.
- Why choose the solution of EM wave equation as $(kx-\omega t)$?
	- Because we want to represent a wave which is travelling in the +X direction.
	- Plane wave in vacuum or medium without any constraints is a TEM wave.
- Whole of electromagnetics can be divided into two parts:
	- One being the mode problem where you define the boundary conditions and see what kind of modes exist in that structure.
	- Other is the scattering problem --- examine this,
