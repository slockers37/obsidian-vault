These have their origin in quantum mechanics but are later found to be occuring in all kinds of waves if the specific **phase matching** condition, under which coupling of two waves outside of a potential leads to destructive interference, causing the waves to be trapped under the potential, is satisfied.

Mathematically, [[BICs occur in systems where atleast one of the dimensions is infinite and cannot exist in compact systems]]. This is not a realistic case so there have been studies to obtain [[Bound States in the continuum|BICs]] using cavities which support standing waves & its structure can be tuned to satisfy the condition required for [[Bound States in the continuum|BICs]] in corresponding infinite system.

[[Bound States in the continuum|BICs]] are waves that remain localized even though they coexist with propagating waves which radiate energy. [[BICs' existence defy conventional wisdom]].
