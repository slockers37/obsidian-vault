[[Electro-Optic effect|Pockels effect]] brings about linear change in RI due to application of [[electric field]].

[[Electro-Optic effect|Kerr effect]] brings about non-linear (quadratic) change in RI due to application of [[electric field]].

[[Electro-Optic effect|EO effect]] appears in non-centrosymmetric materials such Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3), KDP, ITO, Aluminium nitride.
