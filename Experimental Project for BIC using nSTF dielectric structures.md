# Experimental Project for BIC using nSTF dielectric structures

## Tasks
- [ ] Simulate some of the [[Bound States in the continuum|BIC]] based papers using COMSOL by [[2022-04-30]]
	- [ ] Learning COMSOL will come automatically
- [ ] Fabricate nSTF using dielectrics for BIC possibility
	- [ ] Learn about nSTF and GLAD technique
- [ ] Make notes on BIC on the side


> [!question]- How will we obtain periodicity using nSTF?
> We could use pre-patterns but that also are made using EBL so tthat's the limitation.

> [!question]- Why is Si being used predominantly for dielectric metasurfaces?
> This is due to the fact that its refractive index in the optical and near-infrared frequencies is around 3.5. It was demonstrated a few years ago that subwavelength-sized silicon particles can exhibit strong electromagnetic resonances.
> The strong magnetic response of silicon nanoparticles has recently inspired several research groups to develop all-silicon metasurfaces. This property is in contrast to plasmonic metasurfaces where the magnetic response is negligible.
