**Q: Why is optical communication preferred rather than other forms of communication like through copper wires or microwave link?**

A: Copper wire can help in communication for short distances and also only 1 signal can be communicated using this method. For larger distances, EM waves are used for communication. 

Communication through EM waves is highly reliable, economical and the fastest way of communication.

Communication channel introduces loss which has to be minimised for reliable communication. The noise introduced by the channel also needs to be as low as possible.
