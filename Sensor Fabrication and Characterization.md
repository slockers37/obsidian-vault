# Immobilisation/Functionalization
```ad-note
title: Immobilisation
collapse: open
[[Immobilisation]] means to restrict the motion of a [[molecule]] on a surface. 
[[Immobilisation]] is in terms of the [[molecule]] whereas [[Functionalisation]] is in terms of the [[substrate]].

The protocol for this process is that the **supporting surface needs to be stable**. It could be chemical, biological or physical stability. Also support should be **immune to environmental conditions** and should be **non-toxic**.

The protocol for the sensor fabrication should be such that - 
- The supporting surface needs to be stable. The stability could be of chemical, physical or biological type.
- The support should be immune to environmental conditions.
- The support should be non-toxic.
- The immobilised molecules should be non-reactive meaning the molecules shouldn't interact with each other. 
- Also if the BRE molecule after binding with analyte produces a new compound which reacts with the surface then its not acceptable.
- The surface should be able to hold the immobilised molecules for a long time.
