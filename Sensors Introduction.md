# Sensors and Biosensors
*Devices that determine the change in one physical parameter in terms of **magnitude** of another parameter that may be measured more precisely or easily are known as [[sensors]].*

Examples - 
1. Thermometer which measure the change in temperature with the help of change in the length of column of the thermometer.
2. Glucometer which measures glucose concentration in blood in terms of electric current.
3. Pregnancy test kit
4. Infectious disease biosensor

These sensors are of two types - [[Quantitative]] and [[Qualitative]].

*[[Biosensor]] is any device that utilises a biochemical reaction to detect chemical compounds.*

## Components of a biosensor
[[Biosensor|biosensors]] have a sensor surface where a [[biorecognition element]] is attached and when we bring in the analyte (compound to be detected), it binds with the [[biorecognition element]] (BRE)/[[biorecognition element|bioreceptor]] which brings in about a change in any of the physical parameters. There is also another component known as the [[antifouling agent]] which prevents the undesirable binding of [[analyte]] at empty positions on the sensor surface. The change in physical parameters is converted with the help of a [[transducer]] to a measurable signal like Optical/Electrical/Acoustic/Dimensions.

Sometimes the [[biorecognition element|BRE]] can be attached to the sensor surface with the help of a [[crosslinker]]. It is necessary to block off all the empty crosslinker sites so that we don't get a false signal. That's why we use [[antifouling agent]]. [[antifouling agent|Antifouling agents]] are non-specific whereas [[biorecognition element|BREs]] are specific for a particular [[analyte]].

## Parameters for Optical Sensors
- Absorbance in chemical reaction
- Reflectance/Transmittance
- Polarization
- Phase Shift
- Refractive Index
- Light Energy (wavelength): Flouroscence, Raman, etc.
