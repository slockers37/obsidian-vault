# Waveguides

We are going to discuss about transimission of EM waves. It is easier to transmit EM waves of low frequencies, typically about 200MHz with the help of coaxial cables or transmission lines but for EM waves of higher frequencies, we require [[Waveguides]].

[[Waveguides]] are essentially hollow metal tubes or [[optical fiber]]s.

Now we can classify these set of equations into some modes known as TE, TM or TEM modes.

TE mode $\rightarrow E_z=0$
TM mode $\rightarrow H_z=0$
TEM mode $\rightarrow E_z=0, H_z=0$
EH/HE/Mixed mode $\rightarrow E_z,H_z\neq 0$
