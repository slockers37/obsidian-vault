**Why Wavelengths Matter in Fiber Optics?** 

When choosing a transmission wavelength, the goal is to send the most data the furthest, and with the least amount of signal loss. The loss of signal strength during transmission is known as attenuation. 

The three main wavelengths used for fiber optic transmission are 850, 1300, and 1550 nanometers. These wavelengths are used in fiber optics because they have the lowest attenuation of the fiber. The length of a wave has a direct relationship with its attenuation rate − the longer the wave, the less attenuation. 

One cause of attenuation is through something called absorption. Light signals can be lost through absorption by small amounts of water vapor, or trace metals, present in the glass. The most absorption takes place in specific wavelengths, known as water bands.  In between the water bands are windows where the wavelengths have the least attenuation. It just so happens that these wavelengths are also ideal for building transmission lasers and signal detectors.
