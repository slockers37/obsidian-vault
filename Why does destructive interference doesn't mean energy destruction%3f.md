### Points to remember
- It appears that the trivial case of a null wave (with zero energy) is often mistakenly described as an example of destructive interference of two waves moving with opposite am- plitudes (but the same energies) in the same direction, which has led to the misimpression that destructive interference can destroy energy.

- First of all, the concept of wave interference applies only to waves from different sources, or to the propagation in two or more dimensions of a wave from a single source.

- The key here is that the energy associated with a wave has two forms, generically called “kinetic” and “potential”, that are equal for a wave propagating in a single direction, while in the case of destructive (or constructive) interference of counter - propagating waves one form of energy decreases and the other increases such that the total energy remains constant.

- Interference in a wave from a single source can only occur for propagation in two or more dimensions where the system includes entities that “scatter” one portion of the wave onto another portion. The key here is that energy which would appear in one region in the absence of “scattering” appears elsewhere in its presence.
