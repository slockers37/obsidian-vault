Emacs is a graphical text editor that is completely operational using the keyboard. Its most vital functionality in my opinion is [[org-mode]]. 

I use the [[emacs learning|doom-emacs]] config for using emacs. By default, emacs configuration is tough to do and [[emacs learning|doom-emacs]] comes with the basic configuration that anyone can use who isn't that well versed in programming.

[[emacs learning|doom-emacs]] config files are located in `~/.doom.d` folder for macOS. It contains 3 files:
- `init.el` used for installing pre-configured modules by the doom-emacs team.
- `config.el` used for configuring the different packages that you have installed.
- `packages.el` used for specifying packages to be installed that aren't available through the modules in `init.el`.
