“Metasurfaces are artificial photonic devices composed of subwavelength nanoresonators (called meta-atoms), and their functionalities can be engineered by rationally tailoring their geometric parameters.” ([Tseng et al., 2021, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/BMKCAQDN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NKED9G9E?page=1&annotation=BKIM4TIY))

“For instance, plasmonic metasurfaces have enabled the detection of monolayers and their real-time interactions with biomolecules in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) regime,18−22 which is challenging, by using conventional infrared absorption spectroscopy methods.” ([Tseng et al., 2021, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/BMKCAQDN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NKED9G9E?page=1&annotation=KJV9BV5X))

“Although plasmonic metasurfaces provide useful properties, for example, strong electric field enhancement, for various sensing techniques, the intrinsic losses of the constituent metals usually impose limitations. An emerging direction to circumvent such restraints is to replace the constituent materials of metasurfaces with dielectrics that have low optical loss and high refractive index.” ([Tseng et al., 2021, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/BMKCAQDN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NKED9G9E?page=1&annotation=YFZV3H3S))

“In the transmission spectrum, two dips, associated with the electric (at ∼490 nm) and the magnetic (at ∼600 nm) modes, can be observed, respectively.” ([Tseng et al., 2021, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/BMKCAQDN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NKED9G9E?page=3&annotation=M24WZJW8))

“The dependence of the resonance wavelength and the dimension of a dielectric nanoparticle can be described as g(λ/n)=2πr, where g is a positive integer, λ is the resonance wavelength, and r is the radius, respectively.” ([Tseng et al., 2021, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/BMKCAQDN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NKED9G9E?page=3&annotation=CVDBCMW8))

“For different sensing techniques, the resonance wavelengths of dielectric metasurfaces can be precisely tuned from the visible27,30 to infrared (IR)31,32 by the choices of the feature sizes of the meta-atoms and the materials. This useful property enables the realization of various sensing metasurfaces.” ([Tseng et al., 2021, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/BMKCAQDN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NKED9G9E?page=3&annotation=QM244K9N))

“in refractometric biosensing, the Q factor influences the resolution to measure refractive index changes.” ([Tseng et al., 2021, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/BMKCAQDN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NKED9G9E?page=4&annotation=UC5L4822))

“Additionally, the Q factor is closely associated with the field enhancement given by the resonators. Their relationship can be described as P2 = γrad (Q2/V), where P is the field enhancement, γrad is the radiative decay ratio, and V is the mode volume of the resonator.” ([Tseng et al., 2021, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/BMKCAQDN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NKED9G9E?page=4&annotation=QV2KQ354))

“Therefore, metasurfaces with a high-quality factor (high-Q) resonance are also useful for different techniques, such as surface-enhanced spectroscopy.18−22 On the other hand, a higher Q-factor implies a narrower bandwidth, which can bring certain limitations for techniques such as SEIRA and vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy.37 It is because a narrower resonance implies a reduced spectral bandwidth and it might not be able to cover well the molecular absorption bands for chemical specific detection.” ([Tseng et al., 2021, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/BMKCAQDN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NKED9G9E?page=4&annotation=LIC8TXEQ))

>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are waves that remain localized even though they coexist with a continuous spectrum of radiating waves that can carry energy away. Their very existence defies conventional wisdom. Although BICs were first proposed in quantum mechanics, they are a general wave phenomenon and have since been identified in electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves in air, water waves and elastic waves in solids. These states have been studied in a wide range of material systems, such as piezoelectric materials, dielectric photonic crystals, optical waveguides and fibres, quantum dots, graphene and topological insulators. In this Review, we describe recent developments in this field with an emphasis on the physical mechanisms that lead to BICs across seemingly very different materials and types of waves. We also discuss experimental realizations, existing applications and directions for future work.
