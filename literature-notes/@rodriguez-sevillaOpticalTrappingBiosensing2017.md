	- Silica microspheres and polystyrene beads can be used where Silica is extremely stable, hydrophilic, biocompatible because it doesn't swell with change in pH nor is there any porosity changes due to it. Whereas polystyrene beads are hydrophobic and tend to bunch up in water but their refractive index is higher which helps with better optical manipulation.
	- Rare Earth (RE) doped particles usually consists of flouride and oxide materials but there have been instances of RE doped silica microspheres. The main feature regarding RE doped particles is the fact that they are luminescent particles. They have a unique property of Upconversion (UC) which is a non-linear optical process in which lower electronic levels are excited with low energy radiation resulting in higher energy radiation by absorption of two or more photons.
	- Other promising particles include metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, intracellular organelles, fluoroscence dye microdroplets. Metallic NPs are a special case because of SPR capabilities where the surrounding medium dielectric constant is crucial which can be used for sensing. Due to large polarizability, they can be easily trapped as well. However the heating of the surrounding during SPR has to be taken into account for bioapplications.

		- Trap stiffness depends on particle size and trapping wavelength so there is a disparity in the trap stiffness from Silica to PS microparticles.
		- Also the scattering optical force is proportional to $\Delta n^2$ which for high refractive materials destabilizes the trapped object. So most suitable method for optical trapping for this size would be the levitating method where laser if focused from the bottom in order to take advantage of the weight of the particle to counteract the high scattering force.
		- Another approach for optical force enhancement would be coating. Coating with metallic NPs has yielded great results.
		- Finally, other strategies would include modification of shape of trapping laser beam. Underfilling of objective lens optimizes trap stiffness.
	- Nanoparticles
		- Trapping of NPs is difficult due to the decrease in optical force with particle volume. Two possible approaches for increasing the optical force are reducing the optical trap volume and modifying the surface of the NP.
		- Reduction of optical trapping volume can be done using plasmonic nanoantenna or photonic crystal resonator but these techniques require accurate and complex fabrication processes so they are not easy to implement. We can use plasmonic nanojets however to reduce optical trap volume where microspheres are used as microlens to focus the beam with a waist under Abbe diffraction limit.
		- Modifying the surface of NPs for increasing optical force is another method. Gradient and Scattering optical forces scale linearly and quadratically with polarizability where polarizability of a NP depends on its surface charge so replacing the cationic species on UCNP surface with more mobile ones in solution increases the trapping stiffness by about 50 times.

abstract:: Optical trapping has been evidence as a very powerful tool for the manipulation and study of biological entities. This review explains the main concepts regarding the use of optical trapping for biosensing, focusing its attention to those applications involving the manipulation of particles which are used as handles, force transducers and sensors.
Since the 70's, when Arthur Ashkin and coworkers demonstrated that optical forces could displace and levitate microsized particles, optical trapping has seen a steady stream of developments and applications, particularly in the biological field. Since that demonstration, optical trapping has been especially exploited as a powerful tool for non-invasive sensitive measurements. The recent development of synthesis routes has further expanded the possibilities of optical trapping in the area of biosensing where new multifunctional particles are used as a single probe. The synergy between the development of new materials and experimental techniques has led to the appearance of numerous studies in which novel biosensing applications are demonstrated. The design of new materials and optical systems to face new challenges makes it necessary to have a clear idea about the latest developments achieved in the field. In this work, we summarize recent experimental advances in biosensing achieved by optical manipulation of micro- and nanoparticles providing a critical review on the state of the art and future prospects.
