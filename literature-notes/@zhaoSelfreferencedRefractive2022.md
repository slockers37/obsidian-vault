> Self-referenced refractive index sensors allow more accurate measurements and reduce the influence of extraneous factors. This work proposed a high-sensitivity, self-referenced surface plasmon resonance sensor with Na grating and Au-ZnS composite grating. When Transverse Magnetic-polarized light is incident into the prism, three surface plasmon resonances are excited at the interface of Na-MgF2 grating and Au-ZnS grating. The first one is treated as the reference angle, the second and third are forward and backward surface plasmon resonance, respectively. Using the angular modulation, the single-dip sensitivities are 329.41 deg/RIU and 788.24 deg/RIU in the range of 1.330-1.347. To further improve the performance of the sensor, the double-dips method is adopted, and the average sensitivity in the range of 1.330-1.347 is 1117.65 deg/RIU, while the maximum reaches 4390 deg/RIU. Due to high sensitivity, a good figure of merit can be obtained even with a larger full width at half maximum of 3.30&#x00B0;. This proposed sensor provides potential application in the research of biomolecular detection and chemical testing.
