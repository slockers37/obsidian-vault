#### Hey Sumon, Whats On Your Mind? 

- We're going to do the AFM study of all the samples we prepared till yesterday.
	- Lets see how it goes.
	- Didn't go so well. Did scans for 10, 15, 20, 60 nm coatings of Al but couldn't do the rest. Didn't know that AFM takes some time so will do two coatings from now on so that the samples don't get oxidised without any reason.
- Watched [[Mohabbatein]] with [[Ashutosh]] [[2021-10-15|today]]. It was entertaining.
- Ordered the XP-Pen tablet along with a Anker USB-C hub.
