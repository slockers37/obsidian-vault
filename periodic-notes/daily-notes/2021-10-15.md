#### Hey Sumon, Whats On Your Mind? 
- Woke up today at 2:20 pm.
- Finished watching [[The Illusionist]].
	- It was very good. Some things are still unexplained but overall a good movie.
- Also watched [[Good Will Hunting]] finally which is great movie but I didn't like the ending as much. Its debatable.
- I found a great freaking alternative to [[Alfred]] which is free right now so I'm going to uninstall [[Alfred]] now after I have done the necessary work to replace it. Meaning I have to move all my snippets as well as my web searches to [[Raycast]].
