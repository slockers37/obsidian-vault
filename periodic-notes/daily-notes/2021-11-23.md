#### Hey Sumon, Whats On Your Mind? 
- Attended the [[Workshop on Sensors]]
	- First talk was on `Optical Sensors: Development and Applications` by `Dr. Rajan Jha`
		- Need to learn about [[Photonic Crystal]] and [[Photonic Crystal Fiber]]
		- Their applications are quite impressive. Splicing of [[Photonic Crystal Fiber|PCF]] with [[Single Mode Fiber|SMF]] is also quite intriguing.
			- The splicing leads to air bubbles inside the collapsed region which is used for [[strain gauge]] so it could be used in physiological applications as well.
			- 
	- Next talk was on `Synthetic Biology tools to develop functional nucleic acids for Biosensing` by `Dr. Naveen Navani`
		-   Theranostics
		-   In vitro methods are done in test tubes
		-   In vivo methods are done in organisms like bacteria
		-   Macular degeneration related to Blue Filter Specs — RNA Aptamer available
		-   Amplification of DNA sequences using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
	- Next talk was on ``
