### Hey Sumon, Whats On Your Mind?

- Watched [Productivity Power Hour #7](https://youtu.be/hRTltxen6H4) by [[BenCodeZen]]. Learned about TEPOD model and SPEAR model.
- Need to think of a way to use Obsidian for project management. If it is feasible then I will use it. I don't want to use any service that will take my data for this kind of thing. I am using Notion though as my finance tracker which is troublesome.
