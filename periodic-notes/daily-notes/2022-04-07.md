### Hey Sumon, What's On Your Mind?

- Got the link for [Rishikesh trip photos](https://bit.ly/3ufe6Tv) #links/photo 

- #meeting_notes Meeting with [[Sachin Kumar Srivastava|Sachin Sir]] to decide my research topic.
	- Research topic avenues 
		- Plasmonic sensors - SERS, SEF, **SEIRA** (not much work done in this area from India)
		- Dielectric metasurfaces
		- Also do paper searching on [web of science](https://bit.ly/3ujmPEn). It is a great tool. It has lots of filtering options.
	- Other ideas for work 
		- Sandwich two gratings like a waffle and put metal inside. (vague idea)
		- [Look into the other work shared to me via email](https://bit.ly/3ukOpkk).
	- **Final conclusion was read papers and go to him to decide what kind of work to do.**
