[[transducer|Transducers]] are used in [[sensors]] to get the measurable output from the [[sensors|sensor]].

When we say the sensor is a Optical sensor, we mean the transducer output is in optical parameters. Similarly, in an electrochemical sensor, the transducer output is in electrical parameters. ^2856ae
